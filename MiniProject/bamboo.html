        <h1>Bamboo, japan</h1>
        <p>Bamboo Forest, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove or Sagano Bamboo Forest, is a natural bamboo forest in Arashiyama, Kyoto, Japan. The forest consists mostly of mōsō bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) and has several pathways for tourists and visitors. The Ministry of the Environment considers it a part of the soundscape of Japan.
            Prior to 2015, there was a charge to access the forest.
            The forest is not far from Tenryū-ji temple, which is the location of Rinzai School, and the famous Nonomiya Shrine.
            The Sagano Bamboo Forest is situated northwest of Kyoto in Japan near the Tenryū-ji temple. It covers an area of 16 km2 (6.2 sq mi), in one of the temperate regions of the world. The latitude and longitude coordinates are: 35.009392, 135.667007.
            The region experiences unpredictable weather, with a cool climate and bright sunlight. The summers are short, hot, and mostly cloudy. The winters are cold, windy, and partly cloudy. It is also wet year-round. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically ranges from 32 °F (0 °C) to 89 °F (32 °C). The summers last for approximately two months, from late June until mid-September, with an average daily high temperature above 80 °F (27 °C). The winters last for approximately three months, from early December to mid-March, with an average daily high temperature below 53 °F (12 °C).</p>
        <p>The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is one of Kyoto’s top sights and for good reason: standing amid these soaring stalks of bamboo is like being in another world.
            If you’ve been planning a trip to Kyoto, you’ve probably seen pictures of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove – along with the torii tunnels of Fushimi-Inari-Taisha Shrine and Kinkaku-ji Temple, it’s one of the most photographed sights in the city. But no picture can capture the feeling of standing in the midst of this sprawling bamboo grove – the whole thing has a palpable sense of otherness that is quite unlike that of any normal forest we know of.
            You can access it directly from the main street of Arashiyama, a little to the north of the entrance to Tenryu-ji Temple, but it’s best paired with a visit to that temple (exit the north gate, take a left and you’ll be in the grove in no time). There’s just one main path through the grove, which leads slowly uphill. Once you get to the top of the hill, the entrance to the sublime Okochi-Sanso Villa is right in front of you (go in, you won’t regret it).
            The best way to explore the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is by following our Arashiyama Bamboo Grove Walking Tour, which outlines the best route to follow.
            There are two great hotels near the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove – Hoshinoya and Suiran. There’s also the beautiful Arashiyama Benkei ryokan.
